# Prototyping Arduino and AWS
This repositories intention is to get a depth sight into everything discoverd while playing around with Arduinos, other microcontrollers and IoT Cloud Systems.

> Have a look at the [Docs](https://ece-iot.github.io/Prototyping/)

## Structure 

The repository is structured into different development sections.

### [/code](code/)

Here every piece of code is situated. Every sub-directory represents an own [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org), Python for AWS, etc project. 

**PlatformIO**

If the sub-directory represents a PlatformIO project the structure should **always** be the following:

- sub-dir
  - .pio (auto-generated)
  - .vscode
  - code 
  - secrets
  - platformio.ini

This structure ensures that the process of compilation with PlatformIO works properly.

### [/docs](docs/)

This folder contains the doc files for the **github pages** of this project. **It shall not** be modified by hand, because it will be auto-generated by a script

### [/scripts](scripts/)

Here all the essential scripts for setting up new projects within the repository or generating the docs are stored!
