# Prototyping Documentation
This documentations intention is to get a depth sight into everything discoverd while playing around with Arduinos, other microcontrollers and IoT Cloud Systems. 

For prototyping purposes a [**PlatformIO**](https://platformio.org) project has been created. The repository can be *cloned* by using the following link

```
https://github.com/ECE-IoT/Prototyping.git
```

Here is the:

> [**Prototyping Guide**](tutorials/prototyping-guide.md) 

which helps to set up everything correctly. When everything is configured as shown, the documentation of the prototyping phase should be easy and intuitive. 

!!! warning 
    The repository does `sync` the code in `main.cpp`. Thats due to the fact that every developer is using their own code in the `main.cpp`and this would cause a merge mess.
